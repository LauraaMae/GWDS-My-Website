            <h1>UX TASK</h1>

            <P class="TopParagraph">
                My goal for my website was to create a page that showcased what I have learnt so far in my first year
                and semester at university. I have included 3 different designs for a poster focusing on contrast,
                alignment, repetition and proximity; the 8 systems of typography and examples of each; as well as the
                journey I have had so far. The target is to create the website so it can be viewed by Mary and Mic but
                also to show friends/family and future potential employers. It will be a scrolling website with all the
                information on the one page, it will have multiple images to show the different things I have learned as
                well as being examples. I want to make this project successful by having everything in it that is
                required, making it visually pleasing, and work smoothly.
            </P>

            <P class="TopParagraph">
                I am hopefully going to make this a portfolio piece and continue adding to the website after it has been
                submitted to show off my work, as well as gradually improving the website to include new techniques. I
                will hopefully then be able to use this as a portfolio piece for future employers to view to see my
                work.
            </P>

                <div class="uxmediacontent">
                    I have selected a few images to get inspiration from when designing my website, I am wanting to have
                    a simplistic look so I was looking at different websites which reflected this and used this to try
                    and come up with my own design for the website. I used Adobe Colour to help make a colour scheme up,
                    I have got other pallettes in the moodboard that I had not proceeded with but feel it is useful to
                    show the thought process that went through the deisgn process. I feel that going with black and
                    white tones with a singular other colour helps keep the website simplistic yet professional.

                <div class="uxmediacontent">
                    Although optional, I feel a moodboard can be very helpful before designing the page as it helps me
                    get a clear idea of the direction I want to go in. It is a good thing to do as it gets you in the
                    flow of who and what you are designing for. It is helpful for when you are desigining for a specific
                    target market which is not usually your own style it can help you keep on track for what is
                    required.

                    Originally I had wanted to do a scrolling page with everything on the front page, however after
                    completing all the worksheets that were set out I found that making multiple pages was just as easy
                    (Infact maybe a bit easier). The images on the left show my old and new flowchart. My original idea
                    is on the left and my original idea on how I wanted to lay the page out, and the one on the right is
                    closer to the final project. I am much happier with the design now as I feel it is more professional
                    and sleek looking.

                    I wanted to include buttons on each page so the user can flick between the different pages with
                    ease. I wanted a simplistic look and didnt want to overcomplicate the project by including a vast
                    array of colours and designs. I feel that by keeping the same format for each page makes it easier
                    to navigate for the users, as I would like my family to look at the project once I have submitted
                    it.

                    On the right is a wireframe of the final website, It doesnt include all of the pages as I have added
                    more in since creating the wireframe. However it shows the layout of each page and the structure of
                    how it is going to look.
