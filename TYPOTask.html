            <h1>TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS</h1>

            <P class="TopParagraph">
                In Design there are 8 different types of typographic systems they are Axial, Bilateral, Dilatational,
                Grid, Modular, Radial, Random and Transitional. Below are 8 different images of examples of the systems
                used to advertise the The Arnolfini International Centre for Contemporary Arts, and the work of the
                painter Sir Frank Bowling. We used Adobe Illustrator for creating the images.

            <div class="media-container">

                <img src="Images/TYPOAxial_Axial.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Axial is where the text is aligned left or right down either side of a central line. Here I have
                    showed that and added in a bit of contrast by using the blue on one side.
                </div>

                <img src="Images/TYPOBilateral_Bilateral.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Bilateral is like Axial, however instead of being on either side, the text is centred down the
                    middle. You can use this formula multiple times on one page however I have just used it once, I have
                    used the text at different sizes to show hierarchy of the information.
                </div>

            </div>


            <div class="media-container">

                <img src="Images/TYPODilatational-11.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Dilatational involves the use of circles and text is wrapped around an invisible circle. I feel that
                    this style of system goes well with rounded shapes, so I have used circles and I like the design of
                    this as it is simple yet effective.
                </div>

                <img src="Images/TYPOGrid_Grid.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Grid is as it sounds, there is an invisible grid on the screen and the text lines itself up within
                    the grid even though the rest of the other shapes don’t necessarily follow the same grid. I used
                    different tones of the blue to create a bit more dimension.
                </div>

            <div class="media-container">

                <img src="Images/TYPOModular_Modular.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Modular is a repetitive use of the same shape/design in the same image to create unity. I have used
                    hexagons for this and have the text inside, I have also included other hexagons in the design to tie
                    the text together.
                </div>

                <img src="Images/TYPORadial_Radial.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Radial can be described like rays from the sun, the text comes out from round a centre point of
                    alignment. I have used circles to create a bubbly look and feel it works well with the system.
                </div>

            <div class="media-container">

                <img src="Images/TYPOTransitional_Transitional.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Transitional is not widely used and resembles much like layers of the earth or flowing like a river.
                    I have tried to re-create the river look by using blue rectangles as well as the blue in the
                    background of the design.
                </div>

                <img src="Images/TYPORandom_Random.png" width="300" height="300">

                <div class="typomediacontent">
                    Random has no clear typographical system, there is no order to it and the text doesn’t have to be
                    legible. I have used a series of random hexagons in different sizes and tones to carry on this
                    theme. The text itself I have used a few different techniques to make it even more random.
