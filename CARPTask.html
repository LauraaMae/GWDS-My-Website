                <h1>C.A.R.P. TASK</h1>

                <P class="TopParagraph">
                    C.A.R.P. stands for Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity. The following posters
                    have been included in the design of these posters. I have designed 3 different posters
                    for the True/False Festival in Misouri. I have used Adobe Indesign to create these 3
                    advertisement pieces, although tricky at first I now have a basic understanding of the
                    software.
                </P>

                <P class="TopParagraph">
                    Contrast means that there are 2 elements that are vastly different to make them each stand
                    out in their own way. This can be with shapes, colours, size or textures. Alignment is
                    when items on the page are organised in a way where everything conects to each other. It
                    can be aligned along different shapes or with each other. Repetition is exactly how It
                    sounds it can be a repeat of a certain aspect in the design, this can be anything on the
                    design as long as it is repeated. Proximity is to do with how close elements are in a piece
                    also the white space that is created on the page. This helps with the flow of the design
                    and show what is more important.

                        I have created a more simplistic look with this poster to try and show off the images a bit
                        more. I have used a colour for the background that compliments both the images. I have centred
                        everything down the middle except the logo and website in the bottom right. This keeps symmetry
                        across the page and everything looking tidy. I have repeated the same font throughout the page
                        and kept with the white text, I have created contract by using the large text next to the small
                        text showing hierarchy. There is some space on the outside of the poster to highlight the
                        important information in the middle as well as making the poster simplistic.
                    </div>

                    <div class="carpmediacontent">
                        This poster has got a lot of things crammed into the page; it has got 5 images down the
                        right-hand side showing the different things with the festival. I have kept a similar colour
                        scheme on the left-hand side and tried to use a colour that can be reflected in the images on
                        the right. I decided to use a gradient as I could not find an exact colour that would work. I
                        have used contrast with the dark background and white text and have centre aligned the text with
                        each other to create a uniformed look. I feel this piece doesnâ€™t work as well because it is very
                        crammed and could do with more white space.
                    </div>

                    <div class="carpmediacontent">
                        I like this poster and it is the one I have spent more time on. I have kept the colours from the
                        logo and designed the poster around this. The red in the image represents both an T and an F to
                        symbolise this from the festival. I have aligned the text along the edges of the letter so that
                        it all flows in a geometrical pattern. I have used white space at the bottom of the page so that
                        It gives emphasis on the information in the centre of the poster. I originally had just plain
                        black in the background at the top of the poster, but I have now added in text very subtly by
                        using a gradient effect to add a bit more dimension into the poster. I have repeated the font
                        and colours throughout the poster to keep it in unity. I feel this poster went well as it
                        incorporates everything needed for this assignment as well as it being the most visually
                        appealing.
