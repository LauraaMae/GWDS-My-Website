            <h1>REFLECTION</h1>

            <P class = "TopParagraph">
                Looking back on this project I can say that I have really enjoyed it, there were times where it felt
                like I could not get over the next hurdle, but I have managed to pull through and get something in which
                I am happy with. My goals were to make sure the website was functioning, to have everything required for
                the assignment and to use as a portfolio piece. I feel I have completed all my intended goals for the
                website and more, I am proud from going from no knowledge of html and css to being able to create a
                website that functions the way I want it to. I have added in all the tasks required into this webpage as
                well as including extra content from another module. I feel my website could look better however I am
                still happy with the overall outcome.
            </P>

            <P class = "TopParagraph">
                In the end I have ended up making a multipage website, at first, I thought I would go with a singular
                scrolling page as it was going to be easier. However, as I got further through the project, I felt the
                buttons becoming more and more of an option for me. I am happy that I changed my mind as I feel it looks
                much more professional, and I much prefer the way the website flows this way. I had also picked an earth
                colour scheme for the website, but it didn’t feel right, it didn’t feel like it was me. I went with the
                simplistic greyscale with a splash of light red, I felt this was right for my first website as it
                reflects me more.
            </p>

            <P class = "TopParagraph">
                When making the multiple pages I wanted to make sure that you can easily get back to the front page and
                to the other pages with ease. I have put in a navigation system on each page at the top, so it was easy
                for the target market to locate how to move between tabs. I have designed this to work on a computer
                screen, in the future I would like to push myself a bit further and make it work on multiple different
                platforms.

            </P>

                It feels very rewarding being able to see the final product and knowing it was coded by myself,
                sometimes it would be a struggle however I would refer to the worksheets for certain sections to try and
                work it out for myself. I think this is a great way to learn as I am remembering more and more things
                every time I look back. There were a few times where I would struggle and had to ask for help however, I
                tried my hardest to do it myself and I feel more accomplished being able to complete my website knowing
                I done the best I could.
            </P>

            <P class = "TopParagraph">
                I feel the website went well as well as the content within the website, I am happy with my designs for
                the posters and the typographic systems. I feel next time I could push myself more and do something a
                bit different with both however I do still like the end products from both tasks.
            </P>

            <P class = "TopParagraph">
                In short, I am happy with the success of this website, and I look forward to adding more to the website
                and/or creating new and improved websites in the future.
            </P>
