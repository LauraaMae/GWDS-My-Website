                        Creative coding is part of another module within my first year doing Digital Media, I am very
                        happy with some of my
                        work in this module so I would like to include it within my website. You can view my work
                        created in the class, I have
                        tried to put my own spin on them in each one so that they are not exactly the same as what was
                        laid out in the worksheet.
                        I feel accomplished by the end of a worksheet being able to change the colours and make the
                        designs better to look at.
                    </P>

                            This program has been coded for the line to follow the mouse across the screen and slow down
                            when it gets close to
                            the mouse

                            This program consists of 4 different patterns, press on the square and then select a key 1-4
                            and watch the program change
                        </p>

                            This is a pattern that I have created by accident, however I do really like how it can be a
                            different pattern everytime as the angle
                            of the square changes everytime
